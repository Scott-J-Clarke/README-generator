# README-generator

## Description

This application creates the basic structure of a README.md file. 

It was built with Node.js, the 'inquirer' package, and JavaScript.

The user can enter the following information into the README: 

- its title
- a description
- how to install it
- its license
- how to use use it
- how to contribute code to it
- tests included with the application
- and a questions section with their GitHub profile and email address

Through making this README generator, I:

- became more familiar with Node.js
- have a better understanding of the contents of a README
